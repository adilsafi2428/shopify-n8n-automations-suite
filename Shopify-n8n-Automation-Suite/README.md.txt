## 🏛️ Technical Philosophy
- **Scalability:** Workflows are designed for Queue-Mode (Redis) to handle 3000+ daily orders.
- **Security:** Sanitized logic using Environment Variables (no hardcoded keys).
- **Resilience:** Built-in error handling for API rate limits and downtime.

**"Turning manual labor into digital assets."**
